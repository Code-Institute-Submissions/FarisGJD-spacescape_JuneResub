        <h4>Assignment Expedition</h4>
        <p>The year is 2083; you are stationed 1402 light years away, by the exoplanet Kepler-452b otherwise known as Earth 2.0. A coalition of world leaders and government bodies have assigned you the mission of exploring the potential habitability of Kepler which is thought to be desolate. </p>
        <p>As you exist your spacecraft and approach Kepler’s atmosphere, you notice a strange grouping of objects hurdling towards you. OH NO! It looks like the native species have detected your presence and are not too pleased. Quick; avoid being captured or worse killed and get back to your spaceship, reporting your findings to ground control. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Manoeuvers</h4>
        <p>The strategy is simple, avoid the obstacles by clicking the ‘Space’ key or double tap on mobile/tablet screens to make your sprite jump, avoiding death. Time your movements wisely, the longer you’re outside the safety of your ship the harder the obstacles become. Good Luck! </p>
