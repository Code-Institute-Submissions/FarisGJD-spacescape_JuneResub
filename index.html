                    <h4>Assignment Expedition</h4>
                    <p># The year is 2083; you are stationed 1402 light years away, by the exoplanet Kepler-452b otherwise known as Earth 2.0. A coalition of world leaders and government bodies have assigned you the mission of exploring the potential habitability of Kepler which is thought to be desolate. </p>
                    <p># As you exit your spacecraft and approach the planet’s atmosphere, you notice a strange grouping of objects hurdling towards you. OH NO! it looks like the native species have detected your presence and are not too please. Quick; avoid being captured or worse, killed and intercept your orbiting spaceship, reporting your findings to ground control. </p>

                    <h4>Manoeuvers</h4>
                <p># The strategy is simple, avoid all obstacles by clicking the ‘Space’ key (desktop/laptop) or ‘Double Tap’ the screen (mobile/tablet) to make your sprite jump, avoiding death. Beware, not all obstacles are created equal. Some are larger in size and speed. Your best bet is to time your movements wisely, the longer you’re outside the safety of your ship the harder the obstacles become. Good Luck!  </p>
